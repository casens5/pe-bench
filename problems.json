The advantage with the XOR function is that using the same encryption key on the cipher text, restores the plain text; for example, 65 XOR 42 = 107, then 107 XOR 42 = 65.\n\nFor unbreakable encryption, the key is the same length as the plain text message, and the key is made up of random bytes. The user would keep the encrypted message and the encryption key in different locations, and without both \"halves\", it is impossible to decrypt the message.\n\nUnfortunately, this method is impractical for most users, so the modified method is to use a password as a key. If the password is shorter than the message, which is likely, the key is repeated cyclically throughout the message. The balance for this method is using a sufficiently long password key for security, but short enough to be memorable.\n\nYour task has been made easy, as the encryption key consists of three lower case characters.

Without any further rules we would expect to visit each square with equal probability: 2.5%. However, landing on G2J (Go To Jail), CC (community chest), and CH (chance) changes this distribution.\n\nIn addition to G2J, and one card from each of CC and CH, that orders the player to go directly to jail, if a player rolls three consecutive doubles, they do not advance the result of their 3rd roll. Instead they proceed directly to jail.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, the CC and CH cards are shuffled. When a player lands on CC or CH they take a card from the top of the respective pile and, after following the instructions, it is returned to the bottom of the pile. There are sixteen cards in each pile, but for the purpose of this problem we are only concerned with cards that order a movement; any instruction not concerned with movement will be ignored and the player will remain on the CC/CH square.\n\n<ul><li>Community Chest (2/16 cards):\n<ol><li>Advance to GO</li>\n<li>Go to JAIL</li>\n</ol></li>\n<li>Chance (10/16 cards):\n<ol><li>Advance to GO</li>\n<li>Go to JAIL</li>\n<li>Go to C1</li>\n<li>Go to E3</li>\n<li>Go to H2</li>\n<li>Go to R1</li>\n<li>Go to next R (railway company)</li>\n<li>Go to next R</li>\n<li>Go to next U (utility company)</li>\n<li>Go back 3 squares.</li>\n</ol></li>\n</ul>The heart of this problem concerns the likelihood of visiting a particular square. That is, the probability of finishing at that square after a roll. For this reason it should be clear that, with the exception of G2J for which the probability of finishing on it is zero, the CH squares will have the lowest probabilities, as 5/8 request a movement to another square, and it is the final square that the player finishes at on each roll that we are interested in. We shall make no distinction between \"Just Visiting\" and being sent to JAIL, and we shall also ignore the rule about requiring a double to \"get out of jail\", assuming that they pay to get out on their next turn.\n\nBy starting at GO and numbering the squares sequentially from 00 to 39 we can concatenate these two-digit numbers to produce strings that correspond with sets of squares.\n\nStatistically it can be shown that the three most popular squares, in order, are JAIL (6.24%) = Square 10, E3 (3.18%) = Square 24, and GO (3.09%) = Square 00. So these three most popular squares can be listed with the six-digit modal string: 102400.\n\nIf, instead of using two 6-sided dice, two 4-sided dice are used, find the six-digit modal string.\n\n\n",

If there are no more valid moves, then the player loses.\n\n\nFor example, with $n = 5$ and starting with $c = 0$:\n\nPlayer 1 chooses 4, so $c$ becomes $0 + 4 = 4$.<br />\nPlayer 2 chooses 5, so $c$ becomes $4 + 5 = 9$.<br />\nPlayer 1 chooses 3, so $c$ becomes $9 + 3 = 12$.<br />\netc.\n\nNote that $c$ must always belong to $S$, and each player can increase $c$ by at most $n$.\n\n\nLet $M(n)$ be the highest number that the first player could choose at the start to force a win, and $M(n) = 0$ if there is no such move. For example, $M(2) = 2$, $M(7) = 1$, and $M(20) = 4$.\n\n\nIt can be verified that $\\sum{M(n)^3} = 8150$ for $1 \\le n \\le 20$.\n\n\nFind $\\sum{M(n)^3}$ for $1 \\le n \\le 1000$.\n\n",

Quentin, the representative from the company that installed the silo, explains that they only manufacture cylindrical silos, but he points out that it is resting on a square base. Fred is not amused and insists that it is removed from his property.\n\n\nQuick thinking Quentin explains that when granular materials are delivered from above a conical slope is formed and the natural angle made with the horizontal is called the angle of repose. For example if the angle of repose, $\\alpha = 30$ degrees, and grain is delivered at the centre of the silo then a perfect cone will form towards the top of the cylinder. In the case of this silo, which has a diameter of $6\\mathrm m$, the amount of space wasted would be approximately $32.648388556\\mathrm{m^3}$. However, if grain is delivered at a point on the top which has a horizontal distance of $x$ metres from the centre then a cone with a strangely curved and sloping base is formed.

Fred points out to Quentin that it's the radius of the silo that is $6$ metres, not the diameter, and the angle of repose for his grain is $40$ degrees. However, if Quentin can find a set of solutions for this particular silo then he will be more than happy to keep it.\n\n\nIf Quick thinking Quentin is to satisfy frustratingly fussy Fred the farmer's appetite for all things square then determine the values of $x$ for all possible square space wastage options and calculate $\\sum x$ correct to $9$ decimal places.\n\n",

In the event that a chef has more than one equally-optimal elimination choice, assume that the chosen chef is always the one with the next-closest turn.\n\n\nDefine $W_n(k)$ as the probability that chef #$k$ wins in a competition with $n$ chefs. If we have $S(1) = 0.25$, $S(2) = 0.5$, and $S(3) = 1$, then $W_3(1) = 0.29375$.\n\n\nGoing forward, we assign $S(k) = F_k/F_{n+1}$ over all $1 \\le k \\le n$, where $F_k$ is a Fibonacci number: $F_k = F_{k-1} + F_{k-2}$ with base cases $F_1 = F_2 = 1$. Then, for example, when considering a competition with $n = 7$ chefs, we have $W_7(1) = 0.08965042$, $W_7(2) = 0.20775702$, $W_7(3) = 0.15291406$, $W_7(4) = 0.14554098$, $W_7(5) = 0.15905291$, $W_7(6) = 0.10261412$, and $W_7(7) = 0.14247050$, rounded to $8$ decimal places each.\n\n\nLet $E(n)$ represent the expected number of dishes cooked in a competition with $n$ chefs.

Each floor would send power to the floor above it, with the top floor sending power back down to the bottom floor. That way, Hilbert could have the generator placed on any given floor (as he likes having the option) and have electricity flow freely throughout the entire hotel.\n\n\nUnfortunately, the contractors misinterpreted the schematics when they built the hotel. They informed Hilbert that each floor sends power to another floor at random, instead. This may compromise Hilbert's freedom to have the generator placed anywhere, since blackouts could occur on certain floors.\n\n\nFor example, consider a sample flow diagram for a three-story hotel:\n\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"resources/images/0522_hilberts_blackout.png?1678992053\" alt=\"0522_hilberts_blackout.png\">\n\n\nIf the generator were placed on the first floor, then every floor would receive power. But if it were placed on the second or third floors instead, then there would be a blackout on the first floor. Note that while a given floor can <i>receive</i> power from many other floors at once, it can only <i>send</i> power to one other floor.\n\n\nTo resolve the blackout concerns, Hilbert decided to have a minimal number of floors rewired. To rewire a floor is to change the floor it sends power to. In the sample diagram above, all possible blackouts can be avoided by rewiring the second floor to send power to the first floor instead of the third floor.\n\n\nLet $F(n)$ be the sum of the minimum number of floor rewirings needed over all possible power-flow arrangements in a hotel of $n$ floors.

After a guess is made, there are three possible outcomes, in which it will be revealed that either $g \\lt t$, $g = t$, or $g \\gt t$. Then the process can repeat as necessary.\n\n\nNormally, the number of guesses required on average can be minimized with a binary search: Given a lower bound $L$ and upper bound $H$ (initialized to $L = 1$ and $H = n$), let $g = \\lfloor(L+H)/2\\rfloor$ where $\\lfloor \\cdot \\rfloor$ is the integer floor function. If $g = t$, the process ends. Otherwise, if $g \\lt t$, set $L = g+1$, but if $g \\gt t$ instead, set $H = g - 1$. After setting the new bounds, the search process repeats, and ultimately ends once $t$ is found. Even if $t$ can be deduced without searching, assume that a search will be required anyway to confirm the value.\n\n\nYour friend Bob believes that the standard binary search is not that much better than his randomized variant: Instead of setting $g = \\lfloor(L+H)/2\\rfloor$, simply let $g$ be a random integer between $L$ and $H$, inclusive.

    "statement": "It was quite an ordinary day when a mysterious alien vessel appeared as if from nowhere. After waiting several hours and receiving no response it is decided to send a team to investigate, of which you are included. Upon entering the vessel you are met by a friendly holographic figure, Katharina, who explains the purpose of the vessel, Eulertopia.\n\n\nShe claims that Eulertopia is almost older than time itself. Its mission was to take advantage of a combination of incredible computational power and vast periods of time to discover the answer to life, the universe, and everything. Hence the resident cleaning robot, Leonhard, along with his housekeeping responsibilities, was built with a powerful computational matrix to ponder the meaning of life as he wanders through a massive 1000 by 1000 square grid of rooms. She goes on to explain that the rooms are numbered sequentially from left to right, row by row. So, for example, if Leonhard was wandering around a 5 by 5 grid then the rooms would be numbered in the following way.\n\n\n<div class=\"center\">\n<img src=\"project/images/p575_wandering_robot_1_5x5.png\" alt=\"p575_wandering_robot_1_5x5.png\" /></div>\n\nMany millenia ago Leonhard reported to Katharina to have found the answer and he is willing to share it with any life form who proves to be worthy of such knowledge.\n\n\nKatharina further explains that the designers of Leonhard were given instructions to program him with equal probability of remaining in the same room or travelling to an adjacent room. However, it was not clear to them if this meant (i) an equal probability being split equally between remaining in the room and the number of available routes, or, (ii) an equal probability (50%) of remaining in the same room and then the other 50% was to be split equally between the number of available routes.\n\n\n<div class=\"center\">\n<img src=\"project/images/p575_wandering_robot_2_fixed.png\" alt=\"p575_wandering_robot_2_fixed.png\" /><br /><div style=\"font-style:italic;\">(i) Probability of remaining related to number of exits</div>\n<br /><img src=\"project/images/p575_wandering_robot_3_dynamic.png\" alt=\"p575_wandering_robot_3_dynamic.png\" /><br /><div style=\"font-style:italic;\">(ii) Fixed 50% probability of remaining</div>\n</div>\n\nThe records indicate that they decided to flip a coin. Heads would mean that the probability of remaining was dynamically related to the number of exits whereas tails would mean that they program Leonhard with a fixed 50% probability of remaining in a particular room. Unfortunately there is no record of the outcome of the coin, so without further information we would need to assume that there is equal probability of either of the choices being implemented.\n\n\nKatharina suggests it should not be too challenging to determine that the probability of finding him in a square numbered room in a 5 by 5 grid after unfathomable periods of time would be approximately 0.177976190476 [12 d.p.].\n\n\nIn order to prove yourself worthy of visiting the great oracle you must calculate the probability of finding him in a square numbered room in the 1000 by 1000 lair in which he has been wandering.<br />\n(Give your answer rounded to 12 decimal places)\n\n",

The tube contains $N$ marbles of diameter 20 millimetres at designated starting locations, each one initially moving either westward or eastward with common speed $v$.\n\n\nSince there are marbles moving in opposite directions, there are bound to be some collisions. We assume that the collisions are perfectly elastic, so both marbles involved instantly change direction and continue with speed $v$ away from the collision site. Similarly, if the west-most marble collides with the sealed end of the tube, it instantly changes direction and continues eastward at speed $v$. On the other hand, once a marble reaches the unsealed east end, it exits the tube and has no further interaction with the remaining marbles.\n\n\nTo obtain the starting positions and initial directions, we use the pseudo-random sequence $r_j$ defined by:<br />\n$r_1 = 6\\,563\\,116$<br />\n$r_{j+1} = r_j^2 \\bmod 32\\,745\\,673$<br />\nThe west-most marble is initially positioned with a gap of $(r_1 \\bmod 1000) + 1$ millimetres between it and the sealed end of the tube, measured from the west-most point of the surface of the marble.

The marbles' <i>centres</i> are therefore 127, 579, and 772 millimetres from the sealed west end of the tube. The west-most marble initially moves eastward, while the other two initially move westward.\n\n\nUnder this setup, and with a five metre tube ($L=5000$), it turns out that the middle (second) marble travels 5519 millimetres before its centre reaches the east-most end of the tube.\n\n\nLet $d(L, N, j)$ be the distance in millimetres that the $j$th marble travels before its centre reaches the eastern end of the tube.

    "statement": "Two friends, a runner and a swimmer, are playing a sporting game: The swimmer is swimming within a circular pool while the runner moves along the pool edge.\nWhile the runner tries to catch the swimmer at the very moment that the swimmer leaves the pool, the swimmer tries to reach the edge before the runner arrives there. They start the game with the swimmer located in the middle of the pool, while the runner is located anywhere at the edge of the pool.\n\n\nWe assume that the swimmer can move with any velocity up to $1$ in any direction and the runner can move with any velocity up to $v$ in either direction around the edge of the pool. Moreover we assume that both players can react immediately to any change of movement of their opponent.\n\n\nAssuming optimal strategy of both players, it can be shown that the swimmer can always win by escaping the pool at some point at the edge before the runner gets there, if $v$ is less than the critical speed $V_{Circle} \\approx 4.60333885$ and can never win if $v&gt;V_{Circle}$.\n\n\nNow the two players play the game in a perfectly square pool. Again the swimmer starts in the middle of the pool, while the runner starts at the midpoint of one of the edges of the pool. It can be shown that the critical maximal speed of the runner below which the swimmer can always escape and above which the runner can always catch the swimmer when trying to leave the pool is $V_{Square} \\approx 5.78859314$.\n\n\nAt last, both players decide to play the game in a pool in the form of regular hexagon. Giving the same conditions as above, with the swimmer starting in the middle of the pool and the runner at the midpoint of one of the edges of the pool, find the critical maximal speed $V_{Hexagon}$ of the runner, below which the swimmer can always escape and above which the runner can always catch the swimmer.\nGive your answer rounded to 8 digits after the decimal point.\n\n",

Note that rolling both dice at the same time is still counted as two dice rolls.\n\n\nThere exist other more complex procedures for emulating a 28-sided dice that entail a smaller average number of dice rolls.

In fact, amongst procedures for $n=28$ with this restriction, this one is optimal in the sense of minimising the expected number of rolls needed.\n\n\nDifferent values of $n$ will in general use different predetermined sequences. For example, for $n=8$, the sequence (D5,D5,D5,...) gives an optimal procedure, taking 2.083333... dice rolls on average.\n\n\nDefine $R(n)$ to be the expected number of dice rolls for an optimal procedure for emulating an $n$-sided dice using only a five-sided and a six-sided dice, considering only those procedures where the sequence of dice rolled is predetermined.
