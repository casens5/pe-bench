But if two ranks tie, for example, both players have a pair of queens, then highest cards in each hand are compared (see example 4 below); if the highest cards tie then the next highest cards are compared, and so on.\n\nConsider the following five hands dealt to two players:\n\n<div class=\"center\">\n<table><tr><td><b>Hand</b></td><td>\u00a0</td><td><b>Player 1</b></td><td>\u00a0</td><td><b>Player 2</b></td><td>\u00a0</td><td><b>Winner</b></td>\n</tr><tr><td><b>1</b></td><td>\u00a0</td><td>5H 5C 6S 7S KD<br><div class=\"smaller\">Pair of Fives</div></td><td>\u00a0</td><td>2C 3S 8S 8D TD<br><div class=\"smaller\">Pair of Eights</div></td><td>\u00a0</td><td>Player 2</td>\n</tr><tr><td><b>2</b></td><td>\u00a0</td><td>5D 8C 9S JS AC<br><div class=\"smaller\">Highest card Ace</div></td><td>\u00a0</td><td>2C 5C 7D 8S QH<br><div class=\"smaller\">Highest card Queen</div></td><td>\u00a0</td><td>Player 1</td>\n</tr><tr><td><b>3</b></td><td>\u00a0</td><td>2D 9C AS AH AC<br><div class=\"smaller\">Three Aces</div></td><td>\u00a0</td><td>3D 6D 7D TD QD<br><div class=\"smaller\">Flush  with Diamonds</div></td><td>\u00a0</td><td>Player 2</td>\n</tr><tr><td><b>4</b></td><td>\u00a0</td><td>4D 6S 9H QH QC<br><div class=\"smaller\">Pair of Queens<br>Highest card Nine</div></td><td>\u00a0</td><td>3D 6D 7H QD QS<br><div class=\"smaller\">Pair of Queens<br>Highest card Seven</div></td><td>\u00a0</td><td>Player 1</td>\n</tr><tr><td><b>5</b></td><td>\u00a0</td><td>2H 2D 4C 4D 4S<br><div class=\"smaller\">Full House<br>With Three Fours</div></td><td>\u00a0</td><td>3C 3D 3S 9S 9D<br><div class=\"smaller\">Full House<br>with Three Threes</div></td><td>\u00a0</td><td>Player 1</td>\n</tr></table></div>\nThe file, <a href=\"resources/documents/0054_poker.txt\">poker.txt</a>, contains one-thousand random hands dealt to two players. Each line of the file contains ten cards (separated by a single space): the first five are Player 1's cards and the last five are Player 2's cards. You can assume that all hands are valid (no invalid characters or repeated cards), each player's hand is in no specific order, and in each hand there is a clear winner.\n\nHow many hands does Player 1 win?\n\n",

A number that never forms a palindrome through the reverse and add process is called a Lychrel number. Due to the theoretical nature of these numbers, and for the purpose of this problem, we shall assume that a number is Lychrel until proven otherwise. In addition you are given that for every number below ten-thousand, it will either (i) become a palindrome in less than fifty iterations, or, (ii) no one, with all the computing power that exists, has managed so far to map it to a palindrome. In fact, $10677$ is the first number to be shown to require over fifty iterations before producing a palindrome: $4668731596684224866951378664$ ($53$ iterations, $28$-digits).\n\nSurprisingly, there are palindromic numbers that are themselves Lychrel numbers; the first example is $4994$.\n\nHow many Lychrel numbers are there below ten-thousand?\n\n<p class=\"smaller\">NOTE: Wording was modified slightly on 24 April 2007 to emphasise the theoretical nature of Lychrel numbers.\n\n",

    "statement": "Each character on a computer is assigned a unique code and the preferred standard is ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange). For example, uppercase A = 65, asterisk (*) = 42, and lowercase k = 107.\n\nA modern encryption method is to take a text file, convert the bytes to ASCII, then XOR each byte with a given value, taken from a secret key. The advantage with the XOR function is that using the same encryption key on the cipher text, restores the plain text; for example, 65 XOR 42 = 107, then 107 XOR 42 = 65.\n\nFor unbreakable encryption, the key is the same length as the plain text message, and the key is made up of random bytes. The user would keep the encrypted message and the encryption key in different locations, and without both \"halves\", it is impossible to decrypt the message.\n\nUnfortunately, this method is impractical for most users, so the modified method is to use a password as a key. If the password is shorter than the message, which is likely, the key is repeated cyclically throughout the message. The balance for this method is using a sufficiently long password key for security, but short enough to be memorable.\n\nYour task has been made easy, as the encryption key consists of three lower case characters. Using <a href=\"resources/documents/0059_cipher.txt\">0059_cipher.txt</a> (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a file containing the encrypted ASCII codes, and the knowledge that the plain text must contain common English words, decrypt the message and find the sum of the ASCII values in the original text.\n\n\n",

Without any further rules we would expect to visit each square with equal probability: 2.5%. However, landing on G2J (Go To Jail), CC (community chest), and CH (chance) changes this distribution.\n\nIn addition to G2J, and one card from each of CC and CH, that orders the player to go directly to jail, if a player rolls three consecutive doubles, they do not advance the result of their 3rd roll. Instead they proceed directly to jail.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, the CC and CH cards are shuffled. When a player lands on CC or CH they take a card from the top of the respective pile and, after following the instructions, it is returned to the bottom of the pile. There are sixteen cards in each pile, but for the purpose of this problem we are only concerned with cards that order a movement; any instruction not concerned with movement will be ignored and the player will remain on the CC/CH square.\n\n<ul><li>Community Chest (2/16 cards):\n<ol><li>Advance to GO</li>\n<li>Go to JAIL</li>\n</ol></li>\n<li>Chance (10/16 cards):\n<ol><li>Advance to GO</li>\n<li>Go to JAIL</li>\n<li>Go to C1</li>\n<li>Go to E3</li>\n<li>Go to H2</li>\n<li>Go to R1</li>\n<li>Go to next R (railway company)</li>\n<li>Go to next R</li>\n<li>Go to next U (utility company)</li>\n<li>Go back 3 squares.</li>\n</ol></li>\n</ul>The heart of this problem concerns the likelihood of visiting a particular square. That is, the probability of finishing at that square after a roll. For this reason it should be clear that, with the exception of G2J for which the probability of finishing on it is zero, the CH squares will have the lowest probabilities, as 5/8 request a movement to another square, and it is the final square that the player finishes at on each roll that we are interested in. We shall make no distinction between \"Just Visiting\" and being sent to JAIL, and we shall also ignore the rule about requiring a double to \"get out of jail\", assuming that they pay to get out on their next turn.\n\nBy starting at GO and numbering the squares sequentially from 00 to 39 we can concatenate these two-digit numbers to produce strings that correspond with sets of squares.\n\nStatistically it can be shown that the three most popular squares, in order, are JAIL (6.24%) = Square 10, E3 (3.18%) = Square 24, and GO (3.09%) = Square 00. So these three most popular squares can be listed with the six-digit modal string: 102400.\n\nIf, instead of using two 6-sided dice, two 4-sided dice are used, find the six-digit modal string.\n\n\n",

    "statement": "The proper divisors of a number are all the divisors excluding the number itself. For example, the proper divisors of $28$ are $1$, $2$, $4$, $7$, and $14$. As the sum of these divisors is equal to $28$, we call it a perfect number.\n\nInterestingly the sum of the proper divisors of $220$ is $284$ and the sum of the proper divisors of $284$ is $220$, forming a chain of two numbers. For this reason, $220$ and $284$ are called an amicable pair.\n\nPerhaps less well known are longer chains. For example, starting with $12496$, we form a chain of five numbers:\n$$12496 \\to 14288 \\to 15472 \\to 14536 \\to 14264 (\\to 12496 \\to \\cdots)$$\n\nSince this chain returns to its starting point, it is called an amicable chain.\n\nFind the smallest member of the longest amicable chain with no element exceeding one million.\n\n\n",

    "statement": "Su Doku (Japanese meaning <i>number place</i>) is the name given to a popular puzzle concept. Its origin is unclear, but credit must be attributed to Leonhard Euler who invented a similar, and much more difficult, puzzle idea called Latin Squares. The objective of Su Doku puzzles, however, is to replace the blanks (or zeros) in a 9 by 9 grid in such that each row, column, and 3 by 3 box contains each of the digits 1 to 9. Below is an example of a typical starting puzzle grid and its solution grid.\n\n<div class=\"center\">\n<img src=\"project/images/p096_1.png\" alt=\"p096_1.png\" />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<img src=\"project/images/p096_2.png\" alt=\"p096_2.png\" /></div>\nA well constructed Su Doku puzzle has a unique solution and can be solved by logic, although it may be necessary to employ \"guess and test\" methods in order to eliminate options (there is much contested opinion over this). The complexity of the search determines the difficulty of the puzzle; the example above is considered <i>easy</i> because it can be solved by straight forward direct deduction.\n\nThe 6K text file, <a href=\"project/resources/p096_sudoku.txt\">sudoku.txt</a> (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), contains fifty different Su Doku puzzles ranging in difficulty, but all with unique solutions (the first puzzle in the file is the example above).\n\nBy solving all fifty puzzles find the sum of the 3-digit numbers found in the top left corner of each solution grid; for example, 483 is the 3-digit number found in the top left corner of the solution grid above.\n\n",

Working on the principle that \"simple is best\" we should assume a linear relationship and predict the next term to be $15$ (common difference $7$).

It should be clear that $\\operatorname{OP}(k, n)$ will accurately generate the terms of the sequence for $n \\le k$, and potentially the <dfn>first incorrect term</dfn> (FIT) will be $\\operatorname{OP}(k, k+1)$; in which case we shall call it a <dfn>bad OP</dfn> (BOP).\n\nAs a basis, if we were only given the first term of sequence, it would be most sensible to assume constancy; that is, for $n \\ge 2$, $\\operatorname{OP}(1, n) = u_1$.\n\nHence we obtain the following $\\operatorname{OP}$s for the cubic sequence:\n\n<div class=\"margin_left\">\n<table><tr><td>$\\operatorname{OP}(1, n) = 1$</td>\n<td>$1, {\\color{red}\\mathbf 1}, 1, 1, \\dots$</td>\n</tr><tr><td>$\\operatorname{OP}(2, n) = 7n - 6$</td>\n<td>$1, 8, {\\color{red}\\mathbf{15}}, \\dots$</td>\n</tr><tr><td>$\\operatorname{OP}(3, n) = 6n^2 - 11n + 6$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</td>\n<td>$1, 8, 27, {\\color{red}\\mathbf{58}}, \\dots$</td>\n</tr><tr><td>$\\operatorname{OP}(4, n) = n^3$</td>\n<td>$1, 8, 27, 64, 125, \\dots$</td>\n</tr></table></div>\nClearly no BOPs exist for $k \\ge 4$.\n\nBy considering the sum of FITs generated by the BOPs (indicated in <span class=\"red\"><b>red</b></span> above), we obtain $1 + 15 + 58 = 74$.\n\nConsider the following tenth degree polynomial generating function:\n$$u_n = 1 - n + n^2 - n^3 + n^4 - n^5 + n^6 - n^7 + n^8 - n^9 + n^{10}.$$\n\nFind the sum of FITs for the BOPs.\n\n\n",

A dart landing outside the red/green outer ring scores zero. The black and cream regions inside this ring represent single scores. However, the red/green outer ring and middle ring score double and treble scores respectively.\n\nAt the centre of the board are two concentric circles called the bull region, or bulls-eye.

However, it is normal to play a \"doubles out\" system, which means that the player must land a double (including the double bulls-eye at the centre of the board) on their final dart to win; any other dart that would reduce their running total to one or lower means the score for that set of three darts is \"bust\".\n\nWhen a player is able to finish  on their current score it is called a \"checkout\" and the highest checkout is 170: T20 T20 D25 (two treble 20s and double bull).\n\nThere are exactly eleven distinct ways to checkout on a score of 6:\n\n<div class=\"center monospace\">\n<table class=\"center\"><tr><td>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</td>\n<td>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</td>\n<td>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</td>\n</tr><tr><td>D3</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>D1</td><td>D2</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>S2</td><td>D2</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>D2</td><td>D1</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>S4</td><td>D1</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>S1</td><td>S1</td><td>D2</td></tr><tr><td>S1</td><td>T1</td><td>D1</td></tr><tr><td>S1</td><td>S3</td><td>D1</td></tr><tr><td>D1</td><td>D1</td><td>D1</td></tr><tr><td>D1</td><td>S2</td><td>D1</td></tr><tr><td>S2</td><td>S2</td><td>D1</td></tr></table></div>\nNote that D1 D2 is considered <b>different</b> to D2 D1 as they finish on different doubles.

Then,\n\n<ul><li>If the result is negative, all the sheep in that group are deemed to be virus-free.</li>\n<li>If the result is positive, $5$ additional tests will be performed (a separate test for each animal) to determine the affected individual(s).</li>\n</ul>\nSince the probability of infection for any specific animal is only $0.02$, the first test (on the pooled samples) for each group will be:\n\n<ul><li>Negative (and no more tests needed) with probability $0.98^5 = 0.9039207968$.</li>\n<li>Positive ($5$ additional tests needed) with probability $1 - 0.9039207968 = 0.0960792032$.</li>\n</ul>\nThus, the expected number of tests for each group is $1 + 0.0960792032 \\times 5 = 1.480396016$.<br>\nConsequently, all $5$ groups can be screened using an average of only $1.480396016 \\times 5 = \\mathbf{7.40198008}$ tests, which represents a huge saving of more than $70\\%$!\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the scheme we have just described seems to be very efficient, it can still be improved considerably (always assuming that the test is sufficiently sensitive and that there are no adverse effects caused by mixing different samples). E.g.:\n\n<ul><li>We may start by running a test on a mixture of all the $25$ samples.

    "statement": "Fred the farmer arranges to have a new storage silo installed on his farm and having an obsession for all things square he is absolutely devastated when he discovers that it is circular. Quentin, the representative from the company that installed the silo, explains that they only manufacture cylindrical silos, but he points out that it is resting on a square base. Fred is not amused and insists that it is removed from his property.\n\n\nQuick thinking Quentin explains that when granular materials are delivered from above a conical slope is formed and the natural angle made with the horizontal is called the angle of repose. For example if the angle of repose, $\\alpha = 30$ degrees, and grain is delivered at the centre of the silo then a perfect cone will form towards the top of the cylinder. In the case of this silo, which has a diameter of $6\\mathrm m$, the amount of space wasted would be approximately $32.648388556\\mathrm{m^3}$. However, if grain is delivered at a point on the top which has a horizontal distance of $x$ metres from the centre then a cone with a strangely curved and sloping base is formed. He shows Fred a picture.\n\n\n<div class=\"center\">\n   <img src=\"resources/images/0431_grain_silo.png?1678992053\" class=\"dark_img\" alt=\"0431_grain_silo.png\"></div>\n\nWe shall let the amount of space wasted in cubic metres be given by $V(x)$. If $x = 1.114785284$, which happens to have three squared decimal places, then the amount of space wasted, $V(1.114785284) \\approx 36$. Given the range of possible solutions to this problem there is exactly one other option: $V(2.511167869) \\approx 49$. It would be like knowing that the square is king of the silo, sitting in splendid glory on top of your grain.\n\n\nFred's eyes light up with delight at this elegant resolution, but on closer inspection of Quentin's drawings and calculations his happiness turns to despondency once more. Fred points out to Quentin that it's the radius of the silo that is $6$ metres, not the diameter, and the angle of repose for his grain is $40$ degrees. However, if Quentin can find a set of solutions for this particular silo then he will be more than happy to keep it.\n\n\nIf Quick thinking Quentin is to satisfy frustratingly fussy Fred the farmer's appetite for all things square then determine the values of $x$ for all possible square space wastage options and calculate $\\sum x$ correct to $9$ decimal places.\n\n",

That way, Hilbert could have the generator placed on any given floor (as he likes having the option) and have electricity flow freely throughout the entire hotel.\n\n\nUnfortunately, the contractors misinterpreted the schematics when they built the hotel. They informed Hilbert that each floor sends power to another floor at random, instead. This may compromise Hilbert's freedom to have the generator placed anywhere, since blackouts could occur on certain floors.\n\n\nFor example, consider a sample flow diagram for a three-story hotel:\n\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"resources/images/0522_hilberts_blackout.png?1678992053\" alt=\"0522_hilberts_blackout.png\">\n\n\nIf the generator were placed on the first floor, then every floor would receive power. But if it were placed on the second or third floors instead, then there would be a blackout on the first floor. Note that while a given floor can <i>receive</i> power from many other floors at once, it can only <i>send</i> power to one other floor.\n\n\nTo resolve the blackout concerns, Hilbert decided to have a minimal number of floors rewired.

After a guess is made, there are three possible outcomes, in which it will be revealed that either $g \\lt t$, $g = t$, or $g \\gt t$. Then the process can repeat as necessary.\n\n\nNormally, the number of guesses required on average can be minimized with a binary search: Given a lower bound $L$ and upper bound $H$ (initialized to $L = 1$ and $H = n$), let $g = \\lfloor(L+H)/2\\rfloor$ where $\\lfloor \\cdot \\rfloor$ is the integer floor function. If $g = t$, the process ends. Otherwise, if $g \\lt t$, set $L = g+1$, but if $g \\gt t$ instead, set $H = g - 1$. After setting the new bounds, the search process repeats, and ultimately ends once $t$ is found. Even if $t$ can be deduced without searching, assume that a search will be required anyway to confirm the value.\n\n\nYour friend Bob believes that the standard binary search is not that much better than his randomized variant: Instead of setting $g = \\lfloor(L+H)/2\\rfloor$, simply let $g$ be a random integer between $L$ and $H$, inclusive.

This new search routine will be referred to as a <dfn>random binary search</dfn>.\n\n\nGiven that $1 \\le t \\le n$ for random $t$, let $B(n)$ be the expected number of guesses needed to find $t$ using the standard binary search, and let $R(n)$ be the expected number of guesses needed to find $t$ using the random binary search.

The only programmable variables are the number of rectangles to be processed (up to and including $25$), and whether to weld the long or short edge.\n\n\nFor example, the first robot could be programmed to weld together $11$ raw unit square plates to make a $11 \\times 1$ strip.

After waiting several hours and receiving no response it is decided to send a team to investigate, of which you are included.

Its mission was to take advantage of a combination of incredible computational power and vast periods of time to discover the answer to life, the universe, and everything. Hence the resident cleaning robot, Leonhard, along with his housekeeping responsibilities, was built with a powerful computational matrix to ponder the meaning of life as he wanders through a massive 1000 by 1000 square grid of rooms. She goes on to explain that the rooms are numbered sequentially from left to right, row by row. So, for example, if Leonhard was wandering around a 5 by 5 grid then the rooms would be numbered in the following way.\n\n\n<div class=\"center\">\n<img src=\"project/images/p575_wandering_robot_1_5x5.png\" alt=\"p575_wandering_robot_1_5x5.png\" /></div>\n\nMany millenia ago Leonhard reported to Katharina to have found the answer and he is willing to share it with any life form who proves to be worthy of such knowledge.\n\n\nKatharina further explains that the designers of Leonhard were given instructions to program him with equal probability of remaining in the same room or travelling to an adjacent room.

In other words, a lambda-term is closed if all its variables are bound to parameters of enclosing functions definitions.

Two terms equivalent modulo such renaming are called <i>$\\alpha$-equivalent</i>. Note that $(\\lambda x. (\\lambda y. (x y)))$ and $(\\lambda x. (\\lambda x.

The tube contains $N$ marbles of diameter 20 millimetres at designated starting locations, each one initially moving either westward or eastward with common speed $v$.\n\n\nSince there are marbles moving in opposite directions, there are bound to be some collisions. We assume that the collisions are perfectly elastic, so both marbles involved instantly change direction and continue with speed $v$ away from the collision site. Similarly, if the west-most marble collides with the sealed end of the tube, it instantly changes direction and continues eastward at speed $v$. On the other hand, once a marble reaches the unsealed east end, it exits the tube and has no further interaction with the remaining marbles.\n\n\nTo obtain the starting positions and initial directions, we use the pseudo-random sequence $r_j$ defined by:<br />\n$r_1 = 6\\,563\\,116$<br />\n$r_{j+1} = r_j^2 \\bmod 32\\,745\\,673$<br />\nThe west-most marble is initially positioned with a gap of $(r_1 \\bmod 1000) + 1$ millimetres between it and the sealed end of the tube, measured from the west-most point of the surface of the marble.

The marbles' <i>centres</i> are therefore 127, 579, and 772 millimetres from the sealed west end of the tube. The west-most marble initially moves eastward, while the other two initially move westward.\n\n\nUnder this setup, and with a five metre tube ($L=5000$), it turns out that the middle (second) marble travels 5519 millimetres before its centre reaches the east-most end of the tube.\n\n\nLet $d(L, N, j)$ be the distance in millimetres that the $j$th marble travels before its centre reaches the eastern end of the tube.

    "statement": "We define the $\\mathcal{I}$ operator as the function\n\\[\\mathcal{I}(x,y) = (1+x+y)^2+y-x\\]\nand $\\mathcal{I}$-expressions as arithmetic expressions built only from variable names and applications of $\\mathcal{I}$. A variable name may consist of one or more letters. For example, the three expressions $x$, $\\mathcal{I}(x,y)$, and $\\mathcal{I}(\\mathcal{I}(x,ab),x)$ are all $\\mathcal{I}$-expressions.\n\n\nFor two $\\mathcal{I}$-expressions $e_1$ and $e_2$ such that the equation $e_1=e_2$ has a solution in non-negative integers, we define the least simultaneous value of $e_1$ and $e_2$ to be the minimum value taken by $e_1$ and $e_2$ on such a solution. If the equation $e_1=e_2$ has no solution in non-negative integers, we define the least simultaneous value of $e_1$ and $e_2$ to be $0$. For example, consider the following three $\\mathcal{I}$-expressions:\n\\[\\begin{array}{l}A = \\mathcal{I}(x,\\mathcal{I}(z,t))\\\\\nB = \\mathcal{I}(\\mathcal{I}(y,z),y)\\\\\nC = \\mathcal{I}(\\mathcal{I}(x,z),y)\\end{array}\\]\nThe least simultaneous value of $A$ and $B$ is $23$, attained for $x=3,y=1,z=t=0$. On the other hand, $A=C$ has no solutions in non-negative integers, so the least simultaneous value of $A$ and $C$ is $0$. The total sum of least simultaneous pairs made of $\\mathcal{I}$-expressions from $\\{A,B,C\\}$ is $26$.\n\n\nFind the sum of least simultaneous values of all $\\mathcal{I}$-expressions pairs made of distinct expressions from file <a href=\"project/resources/p674_i_expressions.txt\">I-expressions.txt</a> (pairs $(e_1,e_2)$ and $(e_2,e_1)$ are considered to be identical). Give the last nine digits of the result as the answer.\n\n\n",

    "statement": "Two friends, a runner and a swimmer, are playing a sporting game: The swimmer is swimming within a circular pool while the runner moves along the pool edge.\nWhile the runner tries to catch the swimmer at the very moment that the swimmer leaves the pool, the swimmer tries to reach the edge before the runner arrives there. They start the game with the swimmer located in the middle of the pool, while the runner is located anywhere at the edge of the pool.\n\n\nWe assume that the swimmer can move with any velocity up to $1$ in any direction and the runner can move with any velocity up to $v$ in either direction around the edge of the pool. Moreover we assume that both players can react immediately to any change of movement of their opponent.\n\n\nAssuming optimal strategy of both players, it can be shown that the swimmer can always win by escaping the pool at some point at the edge before the runner gets there, if $v$ is less than the critical speed $V_{Circle} \\approx 4.60333885$ and can never win if $v&gt;V_{Circle}$.\n\n\nNow the two players play the game in a perfectly square pool. Again the swimmer starts in the middle of the pool, while the runner starts at the midpoint of one of the edges of the pool. It can be shown that the critical maximal speed of the runner below which the swimmer can always escape and above which the runner can always catch the swimmer when trying to leave the pool is $V_{Square} \\approx 5.78859314$.\n\n\nAt last, both players decide to play the game in a pool in the form of regular hexagon. Giving the same conditions as above, with the swimmer starting in the middle of the pool and the runner at the midpoint of one of the edges of the pool, find the critical maximal speed $V_{Hexagon}$ of the runner, below which the swimmer can always escape and above which the runner can always catch the swimmer.\nGive your answer rounded to 8 digits after the decimal point.\n\n",

Another solution that does not use the $7$ is:\n\n$$211 = (25\u22122)\\times (6+3) + 4$$\n\nDefine the <em>score</em> of a solution to be the sum of the numbers used. In the above example problem, the two given solutions have scores $47$ and $40$ respectively. It turns out that this problem has no solutions with score less than $40$.\n\n\nWhen combining numbers, the following rules must be observed:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Each available number may be used at most once.</li>\n<li>Only the four basic arithmetic operations are permitted: $+$, $-$, $\\times$, $\\div$.</li>\n<li>All intermediate values must be positive integers, so for example $(3\\div 2)$ is never permitted as a subexpression (even if the final answer is an integer).</li>\n</ul>\n\nThe attached file <a href=\"project/resources/p828_number_challenges.txt\">number-challenges.txt</a> contains 200 problems, one per line in the format:\n\n<center><big><tt>211:2,3,4,6,7,25</tt></big></center>\nwhere the number before the colon is the target and the remaining comma-separated numbers are those available to be used.\n\n\nNumbering the problems 1, 2, ..., 200, we let $s_n$ be the minimum score of the solution to the $n$th problem. For example, $s_1=40$, as the first problem in the file is the example given above. Note that not all problems have a solution; in such cases we take $s_n=0$.\n\n\nFind $\\displaystyle\\sum_{n=1}^{200} 3^n s_n$. Give your answer modulo $1005075251$.\n\n\n",

For example, for $n=8$, the sequence (D5,D5,D5,...) gives an optimal procedure, taking 2.083333... dice rolls on average.\n\n\nDefine $R(n)$ to be the expected number of dice rolls for an optimal procedure for emulating an $n$-sided dice using only a five-sided and a six-sided dice, considering only those procedures where the sequence of dice rolled is predetermined.
